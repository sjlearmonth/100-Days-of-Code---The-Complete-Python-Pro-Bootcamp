# Day 2 - Task 5 - Tip Calculator Project

The purpose of this task is to write a Python program which calculates how much a group of people should pay each after dining at a restaurant.

The program asks the user for the following information:

-    How much the total bill comes to.
-    What percentage tip the group should give, 10%, 12% or 15%.
-    How many people are in the group.

The program then uses the above information to calculate what equal amount of money each person should pay. Each person's contribution is then printed out to the console.

In this task I learned the following elements about the Python programming language:

-    Capturing user input of a string containing a float number, the total bill amount, and converting the string into a float value that can be used in a mathematical operation. Capturing user input and conversion to a float value is done in a single step in one line of code by embedding the ```input(...)``` function call inside the ```float(...)``` function call. 

-    Capturing user input of a string containing an integer number, the percentage tip, and converting it into an integer value that can be used in a mathematical operation. Capturing user input and conversion to an integer value is done in a single step in one line of code, by embedding the ```input(...)``` function call inside the ```int(...)``` function call.

-    How to use the mathematical operators to calculate the amount of money that each person should pay.

-    How to use ```f-Strings``` to include float value of how much each person has to pay in the final string printed to the console.
