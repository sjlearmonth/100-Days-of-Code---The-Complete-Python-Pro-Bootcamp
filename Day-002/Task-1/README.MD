# Day 2 - Task 1 - Data Types

The purpose of this task is to learn about the four primary data types in the Python programming language.

THese are as folllows;

-    Strings
-    Integers
-    Floats
-    Booleans

## Strings

Strings are a series of characters enclosed in double quotes ```"``` or single quotes ```'```. They can include any letter, digit or punctuation symbol, such as ```"123 Orchard Drive, Glasgow"```. Individual characters can be accessed in Python by using an operation knowm as "subscripting". This is done by appending left and right square brackets, ```[``` and ```]```, to the end of the string value and placing an integer value between them, like this ```"Hello world."[1]```. The integer value indicates which characater in the string is being accessed, so ```"Hello world.[0]"``` accesses the first character, ```"Hello world."[1]``` the second character and so on.

## Integers

Integers are positive or negative whole numbers like ```123``` or ```-456```, with no decimal point. Very large integers can be written with the underscore character "_" in place of a comma. This makes them easier to read, such as ```123_456_789``` which has the value ```123,456,789```.

## Floats

Floats are positive or negative numbers with a decimal point and a fractional part following it, such as ```3.14156```. They are useful when very large or very small numbers are needed in a Python program.

## Booelan

Booelans have only two values, ```True``` or ```False```. They are used in programs when two values are compared and where the result of the comparison is either ```True``` or ```False```. For example, a program might need to compare the contents of two variables, holding integer values, against each other to test which one holds the larger value. So the result of the comparison can either be ```True``` or ```False```.
