# Day 2 - Task 1 - Data Types

The purpose of this task is to learn about the four primary data types in the Python programming language.

THese are as folllows;

-    Strings
-    Integers
-    Floats
-    Booleans

## Strings

Strings are a series of characters enclosed in double quotes ```"``` or single quotes ```'```. They can include any letter, digit or punctuation symbol, such as ```"123 Orchard Drive, Glasgow"```.

## Integers

Integers are positive or negative whole numbers like ```123``` or ```-456```, with no decimal point. Very large integers can be written with the underscore character "_" in place of a comma. This makes them easier to read, such as ```123_456_789``` which has the value ```123,456,789```.

## Floats

Floats are positive or negative numbers with a decimal point and a fractional part following it, such as ```3.14156```. They are useful when very large or very small numbers are needed in a Python program.

## Booelan

Booelans have only two values, ```True``` or ```False```. They are used in programs when a decision needs to be made which has either a one value or the other. For example, a program might need to compare two number like ```30``` and ```40``` and decide which number is larger.
