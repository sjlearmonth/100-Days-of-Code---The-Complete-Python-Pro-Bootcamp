# Day 1 - Task 5 - Variable Naming

## Introduction

The Python programming language has specific rules on how variables should be named and a Python program will not run if these rules are broken.

The rules are as follows;

-    Make sure variable names are descriptive.
-    Don't have spaces between words.
-    Don't start a variable name with numbers.
-    Don't use special words that are used in the Python programming language, like ```print``` pr ```input```.
-    Choose simple words that are less likely to become typos.
-    Check the company style guidelines if you start work at a company.
-    The convention is to use "snake case" when creating variables names, like ```this_is_a_variable_name```.
