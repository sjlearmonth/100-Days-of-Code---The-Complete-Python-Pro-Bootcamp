# Day 1 - Task 2 - String Manipulation

The purpose of this task is to learn and to practice the use of string manipulation in Python.

I learned how to manipulate the string inside the ```print(...)``` function by applying string concatenation to smaller strings. String concatenation is done by creating two or more individual strings and typing a plus sign, ```+```, between them. That causes the strings to be seen in the console as joined together when the program is run.

## PAUSE 1. Use \n to add another line of "Hello world"

Here I use string concatenation to print the string ```"Hello world"``` two times, each one on a separate line, using one ```print(...)``` command by concatenating two instances of the string with an escape sequence of the new line character ```\n``` appended to the end of each string.

## PAUSE 2. Add a space between the strings.

Here I use string concatenation to insert a space character between the two strings ```"Hello"``` and ```"Angela"``` and call the ```print(...)``` function with the concatenated strings to display the result in the console.
