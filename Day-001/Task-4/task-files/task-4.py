# Day 1 - Task 4 - Variables

# PAUSE 1 - Check the length of the user input.

# print out the message to the user to the user to get the input of his/her name.
name = input("What is your name? ")

# use concatenation to print out the user's name and the number of characters in it
# to the console.
print("Your name " + name + " has " + str(len(name)) + " characters in it.")

# PAUSE 2 - Split everything into variables.

# create the variable "username" and store his/her name in it.
username = input("What is your name? ")

# create the variable "length" and store the number of characters of the user's name in it.
length = len(username)

# print out the user's name and the number of characters in it to the console.
print("Your name " + username + " has " + str(length) + " characters in it.")
