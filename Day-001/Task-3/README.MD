# Day 1 - Task 3 - Inputs

The purpose of this task is to learn and to practice the use of the built-in function ```input(...)```.

## PAUSE 1. Update the code to add an exclamation mark.

I learned how to use string concatenation to inserted user input between two other strings. User input is captured using the built-in function```input(...)``` which is called inside the ```print(...)``` function and between two other strings ```Hello ``` and ```!```.

When the program is run, the user is asked to enter his or her name in the console and after pressing return the string ```"Hello John!"``` is printed where "John" is the name typed by the user in the console.
