# 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp

## Welcome to my GitHub Repository

### Introduction

This repository contains all of my Python programming attempts of the Python coding challenges set in the course 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp by instructor Dr. Angela Yu published on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com).

The repository is structured by having 100 directories, one for each of the 100 days of coding in the course. So the first day's coding challenge solution is contained in the directory ```Day-001```. Each directory contains a README.MD file which describes the project for that particular day of coding in the course.
