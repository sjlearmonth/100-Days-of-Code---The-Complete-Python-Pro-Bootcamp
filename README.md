# 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp

## Welcome to my GitHub Repository

### Introduction

This repository contains all of my Python programming attempts of the Python coding challenges set in the course [100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/?couponCode=2021PM20) by instructor Dr. Angela Yu published on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com).

I used the PyCharm Community Edition IDE from JETBRAINS available [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/). I always checked that I was using the most up-to-date version of the IDE everyday that I spent writing Python code in the course.

Most of the input and output for the Python coding challenges I have attempted use the console of the PyCharm CE IDE.

The repository is structured by having 100 directories, one for each of the 100 days of coding in the course. So the first day's coding challenge solution is contained in the directory ```Day-001``` the second day's coding challenge solution is contained in the directory ```Day-002``` and so on up to the last day's coding challenge solution in the directory ```Day-100```. Each directory contains a README.MD file which describes the project for that particular day of coding in the course.

Below is a visual representation of the file structure of the repository:

### Motivation

My personal motivation for studying this course is to learn new skills in Python programming and development and ultimately use my skills to become a Machine Learning (ML) Engineer using Python to develop ML software systems and applications in industry.

I have previously held positions in industry as a DSP (Digital Signal Processing) Engineer where I designed, developed, implemented, tested and deployed DSP software solutions, in Assembler, Matlab, Perl and C programming languages, for GSM basestation, GSM mobile handset and satellite demodulator systems. I took a career break to care for my wife who suffered a stroke and subsequently became disabled however I am now ready and available to start a new career as a ML Engineer working remotely from home for any employer in the world who embraces the exciting future that lies ahead in ML applications.
